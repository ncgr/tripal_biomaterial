The biomaterial module has a template to retrive project related information for a particular biosample/biomaterial. 
To ensure that projects are correctly retrieved it is essential to add the project_biomaterial table.

Use the following to add the project table in chado and to update tripal with this new custom table.

SQL for adding table and adding indexes

CREATE TABLE project_biomaterial
(project_biomaterial_id  serial not null,
primary key (project_biomaterial_id),
project_id int not null,
   FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES project(project_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
   biomaterial_id int not null,
  FOREIGN KEY (biomaterial_id) REFERENCES biomaterial(biomaterial_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
constraint project_bioamterial_c1 unique (project_id, biomaterial_id)
);

CREATE INDEX project_biomaterial_idx1 ON project_biomaterial (project_id);

CREATE INDEX project_biomaterial_idx2 ON project_biomaterial (biomaterial_id);

Navigate to Home » Administration » Tripal » Chado Schema » Custom Tables

Click add custom table option and paste the following. 

Once the content is saved you should be able to see the custom table with other tables.

array (
  'table' => 'project_biomaterial',
  'fields' => array (
    'project_biomaterial_id' => array (
      'type' => 'serial',
      'not null' => true,
    ),
    'project_id' => array (
      'type' => 'int',
      'not null' => true,
    ),
    'biomaterial_id' => array (
      'type' => 'int',
      'not null' => true,
    ),
  ),
  'primary key' => array (
    0 => 'project_biomaterial_id',
  ),
  'foreign keys' => array (
    'project' => array (
      'table' => 'project',
      'columns' => array (
        'project_id' => 'project_id',
      ),
    ),
    'biomaterial' => array (
      'table' => 'biomaterial',
      'columns' => array (
        'biomaterial_id' => 'biomaterial_id',
      ),
    ),
  ),
)

Next step is populating the project_biomaterial table, for this demo I added dummy values into the table. 


insert into chado.project (name, description) values (' V1.0 of Phaseolus vulgaris','A sequence map of the common bean genome for bean improvement'), ('Gary Stacey et.al. 2014','glyma v2.0 assembly');


insert into project_biomaterial (biomaterial_id, project_id) values (1,44), (2,44), (3,43),(4,43); #Please check the id's and make sure they don't already exist. 

After the insert statements its in necessary to go ahead and sync the project table, to ensure that corrseponding nodes are created. 


An additional template that it included inside the biomaterial module is stock, which retrives the biomaterial-stock relationship. 

To include stock, please alter the biomaterial table to include a new column stock_id. 

alter table chado.biomaterial add column stock_id int;

After alter please populate the stock_id column to reflect the stock-biomaterial relationship.
